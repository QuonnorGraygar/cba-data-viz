Q- I began by adding 1/b with 1/c. To add the two terms together, I had to create a common denominator of 1/bc. Summing this resulted in (b+c)/bc. To isolate for a, I inverted both sides of the equation so that a is equal to bc/(b+c). Lastly, I squared both sides to get my final answer of (bc)^2/(b+c)^2
Q- To solve this, I knew that I had to take the natural logarithm of both sides. Using my log rules, I broke up the right hand side into ln(A) + ln(e^2t). I moved the ln(A) term over to the left hand side and then used another log rule to assert that ln(e^2t) = 2t*ln(e). The ln(e) term simplifies to equal one and then we divide by two in order to isolate for t and get our final answer.
Q- For this problem, I factored the (x^2-4) into (x-2)(x+2). So far, this factored equation suggests that there are two distinct roots at x=2 and x=-2. The 5x^2 at the front of the equation suggests that x = 0 is a third distinct root for the function. Thus, we have three distinct roots total.
Q- We begin by plugging in 1/x^2 everywhere where x is present in the equation. Looking at the denominator, we subtract 1 from 1/x^2 by making it have a common denominator as x^2/x^2. Completing the subtraction leaves us with (1-x^2)/x^2 in the denominator. By flipping this value, we can multiply it with our current numerator. Doing so cancels out the x^2 terms and leaves us 1/(1-x^2).
Q- We complete this problem by plugging in a+h everywhere where we see x in the equation. For the first x in f(x) we expand to get three terms 8a^2 + 16ah + 8h^2. The second term of f(x) expands to become -5a - 5h. The four constant at the end of f(x) remains the same. Summing all these terms together gives us our final answer.
Q- Drinks when left unattended cannot become colder than their environment, so we have to conclude that the drinks temperature does not drop below -10 degrees celsius. We confirm this mathematically by observing T(t). As t gets large, the drink is left unattended for a long period of time. This large t value shrinks output of the negative exponential function found in T(t) down to zero. This leaves -10 as our only value, thus confirming our earlier thinking.
Q- To find the horizontal asymptote of this function, we need to directly compare the leading terms of the numerator and denominator. To condition the denominator, we must factor 4x^4 out of the square root function. When we do this, we are left with 2x^2. The leading terms are of the same degree, so a horizontal asymptote does indeed exist. We divide the coefficient 8 by the coefficient 2 to find that our horizontal asymptote exists at y=4.
Q- The formulas for area and perimeter share a variable of side length. Let s represent the side of a square. We know that the area of a square is s^2 and that its perimeter is 4s. Isolating for s in our perimeter formula tells us that s = p/4. By substituting this into our area formula, we expand to write that area is equal to p^2/16.
Q- We look at the graph at x=2 to see that f(2)=-2. We then plug -2 into our second function g. g(-2)=1 thus g(f(2))=1.
Q- The average rate of change for the car is equal to the slope of distance over time on the interval t=1 to t=4. Plugging in we know that s(4)=20 and s(1) = 2 When we subtract these values and divide them by 4-1, we get our AROC of 6 ft/sec.
Q- The bottle begins with a smaller circumference, thus as water is poured in, it quickly rises in height as it fills the volume of its container. This quick speed levels out as we approach the middle where the circumferene is at its widest. At this point, the water level rises slowly. This fluctuates again as we reach the top of the bottle where we see the bottle's circumference shrink. This means that the end of our graph must have steep slope for the rise of water level over volume.
Q- We know that the area of a circle is equal to pi*r^2 and we have been told that the r(t) = 5t. By plugging the second equation into the first, we can expand and write that the ripple's size as a function of time is equal to 25*pi*t^2. 
Q- As we double the height of the ladder, we must push the bottom of the ladder closer to the wall as our ladder is of fixed length. When regarding this in terms of our slope formula, we reason that the height (the rise) is doubling while the distance from base to wall (the run) is decreasing by some amount. The rise is directly proportional to slope while the run is inversely proportional and so we can conclude that the new slope must therefore be more than twice what it was before.
Q- We rearrange this equation to say that 2 = sin(theta)/cos(theta). Using our trig identity, we can write that 2 = tan(theta), which provides our final answer.
Q- Both of our graphs h(x) and g(x) show cosine waves; however, h(x) has half the period of g(x) as the 2 being multiplied with the x inside the cosine provides a horizontal compression by a factor of 1/2.
Q- The apprentice makes three squares for every five squares made by the master. This means that they create eight squares together at once. After completing eight batches of these squares, they will have made all 64 of the quilt squares. Multiplying 5 by 8 tells us how many squares were made by the master: 40. By deduction, we know that the apprentice then made 24 squares. By subtracting these two values we know that the master made 16 more squares than their apprentice.
Q- In order to not violate the restrictions of our function, we need the interior of the square root function to be greater than or equal to zero. x^6 - 36 is greater than or equal to zero when x^2 is greater than or equal to 36. By taking the square roots of both sides and considering the possible cases, we know that this can only be true when x is less than or equal to -6 or when x is greater than or equal to 6.
Q- Let x equal the length of the shadow. Using similar triangles we know that the triangle formed from the tip of the shadow to the top of the lamp post will have the same angles as the triangle formed from the tip of the shadow to the top of the tree. Since they have equal angles, we can use the tan(thetas) of each triangle to write that 6/(x+5) = 2/x. By cross multiplying, we can rewrite this equality as 6x = 2x + 10. We complete this problem by isolating for x and finding that it equals 5/2 metres.
Q- The equation 2x-3y=4 is a linear function. Linear functions exist everywhere along the space where they are defined, therefore there must be infinite (x,y) pairs that satisfy this equation.
Q- Considering the trip of this vehicle, we see that it is speeding up between t=0 and t=3. From t=3 to t=6 the vehicle is slowing down; however, it is still moving forward, therefore it continues to get farther from it's initial location. After t=6 we see that the car begins reversing back towards its initial location. It does this for the remainder of the time and it never reverses enough to go past
the starting location. Thus we conclude that the vehicle was furthest at t=6 minutes.
