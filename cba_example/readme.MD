#### CBA Example Folder 

Folder contains an example of a proper submission for the CBA.

Folder contains these files:
- `cba_mc_submission.txt`: a twenty character string that describes the sequence of multiple choice options selected by you (the examinee).
- `cba_text_submission.txt`: a text file that contains the written responses for each of the CBA questions. In your own submission, each question must begin with a linebreak followed by `Q- ` (so `\nQ- `), otherwise they will not be processed properly by the Jupyter Notebook that is used to make spider plots.
- `cba_presentation.pdf`: a presentation that details the design objectives for the CBA. Initially presented at the CMS Online Education meeting, it currently provides static information about the assessment.
- `spider_plot.png`: an example plot of what the outputted calculus readiness data profile would look like upon completion.
